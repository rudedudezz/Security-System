# Security-System Using Arduino

It's a security system to monitor a door or window and would determine, whether the door/window is closed or opened . Moreover, the system can be armed or disarmed. In order to alter the states, a pin must be entered using a number pad. Additionally, there is a display which shows the current state of the door/window.

1.FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 

1.1	Summary of Functions

The Security System requires a embedded system based solution for a program whose primary functions are to:
•	Monitor a door or window  
•	Determine the open state of the door/window   
•	Determine the armed/disarmed state of the system  
•	Take necessary steps in both armed/disarmed state  

1.2	Functional Requirements
In order to accomplish the above articulated needs, the Security System requires the following functionality:
•	Status Management  
  •	Indication of the current state of the door/window  
  •	Ability to switch between states “open” and “closed”  

•	Alarm System Management  
  •	Indication of the current state of the alarm system   
  •	Ability to control the alarm system by using passwords  
  •	Make alarm sound while someone trying to break into the door/window in “closed” state  
 

2.NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

2.1	Summary of Non-functional Characters

The non-functional requirements should describe the system's operation capabilities and constraints that enhance its functionality, including safety, reliability, etc.

2.2	Non-functional Requirements
•	System Security  
  •	The embedded system hardware design should fulfil the needs of system safety    
  •	Use of sustainable hardware components   
  •	Safe power supply for the system  
  •	Safe operation in components and wire connection  

•	The software programming should fulfil the need of system safety  
  •	Data encryption when using password function  
  •	Reliable coding to ensure the functionality of the system  

•	System Complexity  
  •	Reducing of the total number of wires/components when possible  
  •	Optimization of the system by using different components  


3.DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE DESIGN

•	Keypad & LCD1602: used for entering password in order to change between “armed” and “disarmed” states  
•	Speaker: make alarm sound when moving objects passing through under “armed” state  
•	Laser transmitter & laser receiver: detect moving objects passing through   


4.HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 	  

•	LCD Display   
•	Number keypad 
•	Breadboard  
•	Arduino Uno  
• Speaker  
•	Wires  
•	Laser emitter  
•	Laser receiver
